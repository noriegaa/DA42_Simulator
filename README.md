Preliminary DA42 Simulator
==========================

Ben,

If you are seeing this, I must have done something right. Here is the model I was telling you about in case you want to look at how I avoided the report license. There is one issue, which is that you have to have GhostScript installed on your computer (I will try to add it on the issues section). This is very simple model and is more of a proof of concept than anything else, both of the testing as well as GitHub. Here is how to run the file. 

## Quick start

**(1)**  Open Matlab and change your current directory to the DA42_Simulator folder.

**(2)**  Run the script *test_startup.m* to load the proper paths in Matlab. This will automatically run *test2c10.m*.


All functions are under 'Support Files/Functions'. There is no trimming of the airplane yet, because I wanted to try an alternative to jj_trim. I have the code to do it and I will added as soon as I can.

Thanks,
Alfonso
